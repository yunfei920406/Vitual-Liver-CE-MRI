### Representative Actual and DL-Synthesized CE-MRI for HCC Cases

The following figure shows the representative actual and DL-synthesized CE-MRI of three patients with HCC. 

**Notes:**

1. Each column represents a different enhanced phase. Each row depicts either actual (Real) or DL-synthesized (DL-syn) CE-MRI. Actual images are obtained with MRI scanning, while DL-synthesized images are generated by the deep learning model. Every two rows of images pertain to the same patient.  
2. Images of the pre-contrast phase acquired by MRI scanning are listed in all rows.  
3. The yellow, green, and blue arrows represent the arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), washout, and enhancing capsule, respectively.

### Representative Cases of Non-HCC Lesions

The following figure shows the representative cases of non-HCC lesions, including focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), cyst, hemangioma, and dysplastic nodule.
