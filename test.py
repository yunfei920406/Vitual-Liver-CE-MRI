a = list("Visualization and quantitative analysis of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) microenvironment are crucial for tumor assessment. The applicant's previous research has demonstrated that various quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can reflect different structural and functional information, such as cell density and tissue perfusion, and can be applied to non-invasive diagnostic assessments of tumors. These studies suggest that the use of different functional MRI techniques to quantify functional, structural, and metabolic information can enable imaging of the microenvironment of HCC, including its structure, metabolism, and function. However, there is currently a lack of technology for visualizing the microenvironment of HCC in clinical practice. In this study, we aim to establish an intelligent environmental imaging technology for HCC and its microenvironment, which integrates the qualitative spatial distribution and quantitative proportion of different tumor environments in HCC and its microenvironment. Based on the quantitative determination of environmental components, we will develop artificial intelligence prediction algorithms for non-invasive diagnosis, pathological prediction, and prognostic risk assessment of HCC. The proposed technology is expected to fill the current technical gap in the lack of visualization of the HCC microenvironment in clinical practice and has the potential to be extended to other tumors. Additionally, the integrated qualitative and quantitative results will aid in more accurate diagnosis and evaluation of HCC, guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment.")
